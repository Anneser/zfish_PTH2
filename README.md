#  Modulation of behavior in zebrafish by the neuropeptide PTH2 

Here we provide analysis code for the paper _"The neuropeptide Pth2 modulates social behavior and anxiety levels in zebrafish"_. 
The data is provided in [this EDMOND repository](https://dx.doi.org/10.17617/3.6v). Individual data files should be placed within the same folder as the analysis scripts, 
otherwise the file locations have to be updated in the scripts.

All figures dependent on computational analysis can be reproduced with this code.
